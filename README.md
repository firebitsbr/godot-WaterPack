## Installation

Simply put the `water_pack` folder(the one inside the addons folder) into your project's `addons` folder. Simple as that!

## Usage

All 3D Water bodies are accessible under `Spatial`, while `Water2D` is under `Node2D`.

Other effects such as waterfall and rain are currently incomplete presets. They'll be completed eventually.
